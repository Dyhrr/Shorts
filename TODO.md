# ✅ ShortSplit TODO – Pre-Launch Checklist

This is the "make it actually usable and slightly less cursed" list for getting ShortSplit to a shareable 1.0 state.

---

## 🧠 Core Functionality

- [ ] Drag-and-drop reliably processes both top and bottom clips

---

## 🖥️ UI/UX Polishing

- [ ] Clear labeling for top (voice) and bottom (visual) clip inputs
- [ ] Light/dark mode toggle (even a dummy one is fine)
- [ ] "Create" button triggers complete render chain, with feedback

---

## ⚙️ Settings and Configuration

- [ ] (Optional) Output resolution toggle or presets

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

- [ ] Empty top audio = warning but still renders (with empty subs?)

---

## 📦 Packaging and Delivery

- [ ] PyInstaller build script for lazy end users (optional but nice)

---

## 🎨 Flavor and Personality
- [ ] loading animation or quote-of-the-day just for vibe
